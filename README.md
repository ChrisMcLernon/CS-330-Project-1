# CS-330-Project-1


Designing software involves a methodical approach. Firstly, grasp the problem's scope and requirements. Second, conceptualize the solution, focusing on user experience (UX) and functionality. Plan the implementation, ensuring code modularity and maintainability. Write and test the code, iteratively refining it based on feedback. Document the process and deploy the final product, considering user support.

Working on the project has honed design skills such as visual aesthetics and user-centered thinking. The process followed included requirement analysis, conceptualization, user interaction and environment design, modular coding, testing, and iteration. These skills and strategies can be applied to future projects, emphasizing user-centric design, code modularity, and iterative development.

In approaching program development, understand the problem, outline the plan, incrementally implement and test the code, refine and document it. The gained knowledge in computational graphics and visualizations can be applied in fields like game design, data visualization, and emerging technologies, enriching educational and professional pathways with versatile and applicable skills.
